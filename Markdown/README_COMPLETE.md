## 📊 What This System Does

### The Big Picture
This is an AI system that predicts stock prices and market movements across different countries using multiple types of information - not just price charts, but also economic data and news sentiment. Think of it as a "universal translator" for financial markets that can learn patterns from one country and apply them to another.

### What It Predicts
- **Stock Prices**: Next 1-5 days of price movements
- **Market Risk**: How volatile or risky the market will be
- **Crisis Detection**: Early warning for market crashes or unusual events
- **Buy/Sell Signals**: Actionable trading recommendations

### What Makes It Special

#### 1. Works Across Countries
- Learns from US stock market data
- Applies that knowledge to predict Indian stocks (NIFTY, SENSEX)
- Also works for Brazilian markets (BOVESPA)
- Can adapt to any country's market with minimal additional training

#### 2. Uses Multiple Information Sources
- **Price Data**: Traditional stock charts, volume, technical indicators
- **Economic Data**: GDP growth, inflation rates, unemployment, interest rates
- **News Sentiment**: Financial news headlines analyzed for positive/negative sentiment

#### 3. Explains Its Decisions
Unlike a "black box" AI, this system tells you:
- Which factors influenced the prediction most
- Why it thinks the price will go up or down
- What economic indicators are driving the forecast
- Which news events are impacting the market

#### 4. Handles Market Crises
The system is specifically designed to:
- Detect when markets are entering crisis mode (like COVID-19 crash)
- Adapt its predictions during volatile periods
- Maintain accuracy even during unprecedented events

- **HOLD** - Neutral outlook, no clear direction
- **SELL/STRONG SELL** - Negative outlook with warning signs

#### Confidence Score (0-100%)
- **90%+** - Very high confidence, strong signals
- **70-90%** - High confidence, multiple supporting factors
- **50-70%** - Moderate confidence, mixed signals
- **<50%** - Low confidence, uncertain conditions

#### Risk Levels
