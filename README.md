# Machine Learning Nifty

A modern machine learning project focused on delivering efficient and scalable ML solutions.

## 🚀 Features

- Clean, modular architecture for ML workflows
- Support for various ML algorithms and models
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering utilities
- Model evaluation and visualization tools
- Easy-to-use API for predictions

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/elecxDev/machine-learning-nifty.git
cd machine-learning-nifty
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Usage

### Quick Start

```python
from ml_nifty import MLModel

# Initialize the model
model = MLModel()

# Load your data
data = model.load_data('path/to/your/data.csv')

# Train the model
model.train(data)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

### Example Workflows

Coming soon! We'll add detailed examples for:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment
