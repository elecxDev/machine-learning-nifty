Problem Objective ( with three subject)
1. Develop a truly universal, multimodal Transformer model for financial forecasting across assets and regions
2. Integrate Explainable AI (SHAP, attention-heatmaps) to reveal key drivers under different conditions
3. Evaluate:
–Forecast accuracy vs. baselines (LSTM, ARIMA)
–Adaptation to volatility regimes (backtestCOVID-19, 2008)
–Generalization to new markets (US → India, Brazil, Japan)
